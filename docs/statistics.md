-   [Statistical thinking for the 21st century](http://statsthinking21.org/) by Russ Poldrack: "I am trained as a psychologist and neuroscientist, not a statistician. However, my research on brain imaging for the last 20 years has required the use of sophisticated statistical and computational tools, and this has required me to teach myself many of the fundamental concepts of statistics. Thus, I think that I have a solid feel for what kinds of statistical methods are important in the scientific trenches."

Partial least squares regression:

This is particularly useful for highdimensional neuroimaging data (particularly when correlating with genetic/transcriptome data). It finds a linear regression model by projecting the predicted variables and the observable variables to a new space.

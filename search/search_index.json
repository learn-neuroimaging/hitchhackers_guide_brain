The current version of BIDS covers raw data and some aspects of derivative data (e.g preprocessed data). In general BIDS also allows you to more easily share your data and use plenty of analytical tools . If you would like to use BIDS but you have no idea what a JSON file and / or the length of the specification document scares you, head over to the BIDS starter kit to find tutorials and scripts to help you rearrange your data.
